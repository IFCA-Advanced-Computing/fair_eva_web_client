/*
 * HTML5 Shiv replacement
 *
 * The HTML5 Shiv enables the use of HTML5 elements in older versions of
 * Internet Explorer by creating those elements via JavaScript.  In
 * modern browsers this functionality is unnecessary.  This placeholder
 * exists to satisfy template references and intentionally contains no
 * operational code.
