/*
 * Respond.js replacement
 *
 * Respond.js is a polyfill that enables CSS3 media queries in older
 * versions of Internet Explorer.  Since this project targets modern
 * browsers and does not need to support IE8, this placeholder file
 * exists solely to prevent missing resource errors in the templates.
 * It intentionally does nothing.
